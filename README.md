Problem Statement:
Hotels play a crucial role in traveling and with the increased access to information, new pathways of selecting the best ones have emerged. In this project, we would do text analysis in order to predict the rating from a review. We would first start by cleaning the dataset so that we can start looking for stopwords. Once we eliminate stopwords and get words that describe each of the ratings, we divide the data set into training and testing. We would build our ML models on the training data and use the test data for testing. Next, we would compare the accuracy and suggest the model that worked best for this prediction.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of more than 20k reviews crawled from the Tripadvisor website. The dataset has two columns:
Reviews
Ratings

Techniques:
Random Forest, SVM, and LSTM.
